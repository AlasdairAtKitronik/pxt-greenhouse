# Data Logging

## Setup and Data Collection
### Introduction Step @unplugged
A really useful feature of the Smart Greenhouse is the data logging functionality - being able to measure, store and then transmit data to a computer. This means that the relationships between environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and light levels can be analysed and the results used to improve plant care and growth. This tutorial will go through the basics of gathering data readings, storing them and then transmitting them to a computer via USB. It will also cover the use of the MakeCode serial console and importing data into Microsoft Excel. 

### micro:bit Setup @unplugged
For this tutorial, the BBC micro:bit plugged into the Environmental Control Board needs to be connected via USB to a computer all the time, and the micro:bit needs to be 'Paired' within MakeCode (**Note:** To be able to 'Pair' in MakeCode, the micro:bit firmware must be 0249 or higher; click [here](https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/firmware/) for more information).  
  
Once the micro:bit is connected via USB, click the three dots to the right of the ``|Download|`` button, then select "Pair device" from the list.

This will open the Pairing window. From there, click the ``|Pair device|`` button, select the connected micro:bit from the list and click "Connect".  
![GIF showing connecting the micro:bit](https://KitronikLtd.github.io/pxt-kitronik-smart-greenhouse/assets/pair-microbit-part-2.gif)  
The ``|Download|`` button should now have the USB symbol in front of it. The micro:bit is now paired and the rest of the tutorial can be completed.

### Step 1
To set the micro:bit up for data logging and transmission, a few blocks need to be added to the ``||basic:on start||`` section.  
The first of these is the ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.set data output to USB||`` block which can be found in the ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.Data Logging||`` section of the ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.Greenhouse||`` category. This sets up everything in the background to enable any data collected by the program to be sent to the computer using the connecting USB cable.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
kitronik_smart_greenhouse.setDataForUSB()
```

### Step 2
The next two blocks deal with the data format. First, add in a ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.separate entries||`` block at the end of the ``||basic:on start||`` section. This block determines what will come inbetween each data entry when it is transmitted, which then helps with importing the data to a spreadsheet. For this tutorial, select ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.Semicolon||`` from the drop-down list.  
Finally, include an ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.add data entry headings||`` block and type in the title "Light".

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
kitronik_smart_greenhouse.setDataForUSB()
kitronik_smart_greenhouse.selectSeparator(kitronik_smart_greenhouse.Separator.semicolon)
kitronik_smart_greenhouse.addTitle("Light")
```

### Step 3
Now that things are set up, the data measurement process can be sorted. As the data title might suggest, the program is going to use the micro:bit to mmeasure the light level (the LED display can be used to do this if all the LEDs are turned off.).  
Add an ``||input:on button A pressed||`` block from the ``||input:Input||`` category. Inside this, add a ``||loops:repeat||`` loop from the ``||loops:Loops||`` category, and change the number so that it repeats **25** times.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 25; index++) {
        
    }
})
```

### Step 4
Within the ``||loops:repeat||`` loop, the light level will be measured and added to a data store. **Note:** There is a limit of 100 entries in the data store.  
Inside the loop, add an ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.add data||`` block from the ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.Data Logging||`` section of the ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.Greenhouse||`` category. The block can only use strings, so where values measured as numbers are needed, a ``||text:convert to text||`` is required (from the ``||text:Text||`` category under **Advanced**). Insert one inside the slot in the ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.add data||`` block. The value to be converted to text is ``||input:light level||`` which can be found in the ``||input:Input||`` category.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 25; index++) {
        kitronik_smart_greenhouse.addData(convertToText(input.lightLevel()))
    }
})
```

### Step 5
Currently, when ``||input:button A||`` is pressed, the program will measure the light level 25 times, with each measurement coming immediately after the previous one. This doesn't leave much time for changes to be identified, so add a 2 second ``||basic:pause||`` after the ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.add data||`` block. Another slight issue is that there is no way to know when the data collection has finished. After the ``||loops:repeat||`` loop, add a ``||basic:show icon âœ“||``, and before the loop, a ``||basic:clear screen||`` block - both of these can be found in the ``||basic:Basic||`` category.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    basic.clearScreen()
    for (let index = 0; index < 25; index++) {
        kitronik_smart_greenhouse.addData(convertToText(input.lightLevel()))
        basic.pause(2000)
    }
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Yes)
})
```

### Step 6
The data logging functionality has been set up and the data measurement process has been organised, the next thing is triggering the transmission of the collected data.  
From the ``||input:Input||`` category, add an ``||input:on button B pressed||`` block, and inside, put a ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.transmit all data||`` block from the ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.Data Logging||`` section of the ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.Greenhouse||`` category. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, function () {
    kitronik_smart_greenhouse.sendAllData()
})
```

### Step 7
Finally, it would be good to have a way to delete the data to make space for more.  
Add an ``||input:on button A+B pressed||`` block and inside, place a ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.clear all data||`` block from the ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.Data Logging||`` section of the ``||kitronik_smart_greenhouse.Greenhouse||`` category.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.AB, function () {
    kitronik_smart_greenhouse.clearData()
})
```

### Step 8
Click ``|Download|`` and transfer the code to the Environmental Control Board.  
Press ``||input:Button A||`` and then vary the brightness of light visible to the micro:bit LED display (for example, shine a torch, then cover the screen, or tilt it up towards ceiling lights). A tick will be displayed when the data collection is complete.  
Keep the micro:bit plugged in through the data collection, and once complete, move onto the next stage of the tutorial.

## Transmitting the Data
### Step 1
Some light level measurements will now be stored on the micro:bit, ready to be transferred to the computer via the USB cable.  
Press ``||input:Button B||`` on the micro:bit. This will will make the "**Show console** Device" button appear under the micro:bit simulation image. Click on the new button.

#### ~ tutorialhint

### Step 2
After clicking the console button, the code editor window will disappear and be replaced with either a white screen (in which case, press ``||input:Button B||`` again) or a screen with a scrolling chart at the top and the transmitted data text at the bottom - this is the console display.  
In the top right corner of the window there are three buttons. To export and download the data as a text file, click the button furthest to the right.

### Step 3
Now open a new spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel (this has also been tested in Google Sheets and LibreOffice Calc, although they have a slightly different import process).  
Select a cell in the spreadsheet, and then go to the "Data" tab in the top bar. Click on "From Text" to begin the data import process.

### Step 4
A File Explorer window will have now opened. Go the folder where the text file from MakeCode was downloaded (probably "Downloads") and select the file. Click the "Import" button at the bottom of the window. This will start the "Text Import Wizard".

### Step 5
Make sure the "Delimited" box is checked, as the data is separated by semicolons. Click "Next".
Check the "Semicolon" box and uncheck the "Tab" box this will make sure that the correct separator between data entries is identfied. Click "Next" and then "Finish".  
In the final window, make sure "Existing worksheet" is checked as the import location and then click "OK". The data will now have been imported to the spreadsheet and is ready to be analysed.
